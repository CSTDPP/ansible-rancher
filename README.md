# Ansible Playbooks and Roles for Rancher


These Ansible playbook and roles can be used to:
* create a Rancher Control Plane using [rke]() and [helm]()
* add a [custom kubernetes cluster] to an existing Rancher Control Plane

## Inventory

Check [inventories/site](./inventories/site) for a sample inventory.

There are two special ansible groups:
* `rke_rancher_clusters`: Hosts in this group represent a Rancher Control Plane instance
* `custom_k8s_clusters`: Hosts in this group represent a custom kubernetes cluster added to a Rancher Control Plane

Members (Nodes) of the Rancher Control Plane and the Kubernetes cluster are managed with the following ansible groups.

### Rancher Control Plane

For Rancher Control Plane: Assuming we have a Rancher Control Plane with the name `cluster_rancher`, we create the `cluster_rancher` host to the `rke_rancher_clusters` group and then add all nodes for this to the group `rke_cluster_rancher`, so the Rancher Control Plane name with a `rke_` prefix.

```ini
[rke_rancher_clusters]
cluster_rancher # Belongs to Ansible Group rke_cluster_rancher

[rke_cluster_rancher]
rancher01
rancher02
rancher03

```

Make sure to set at least the following vars:
* For the `cluster_rancher` special host, you have to set `rancher_hostname` and `rancher_admin_password`. Check [inventories/host_vars/cluster_rancher.yml](./inventories/host_vars/cluster_rancher.yml) and [roles/rke_rancher_clusters/defaults/main.yaml](./roles/rke_rancher_clusters/defaults/main.yaml]) for more details.
* Set the `k8s_roles` each of the member should have (for a Rancher Control Plane this is normally `controlplane`, `etcd`, `worker`). See [inventories/group_vars/rke_cluster_rancher.yml](./inventories/group_vars/rke_cluster_rancher.yml) as an example.


### Custom Kubernetes Cluster

For a custom Kubernetes cluster managed with a Rancher Control Plane: Assuming our cluster has the name `mycluster` we create a host `rancher_mycluster` in the `custom_k8s_clusters` group (so cluster name with a `rancher_` prefix). The member nodes of this cluster are then added to a group with the name `mycluster`. To use some dedicated roles on some nodes you can use other ansible groups which are children of the `mycluster` group. 


```ini
[custom_k8s_clusters]
rancher_mycluster

[mycluster:children]
mycluster_master
mycluster_worker

[mycluster_master]
master01

[mycluster_worker]
worker01
```

Make sure to set at least the following vars:
* For the `ranchr_mycluster` special host you have to set at least the `custom_k8s_cluster_api_key` & `custom_k8s_cluster_rancher_host` variable. Check [roles/custom_k8s_cluster/defaults/main.yaml](./roles/custom_k8s_cluster/defaults/main.yaml]) for more details and variables.
* Set the `k8s_roles` each member should have. See [inventories/group_vars/mycluster_master.yml](./inventories/group_vars/mycluster_master.yml) and [inventories/group_vars/mycluster_worker.yml](./inventories/group_vars/mycluster_worker.yml) as an example.

## Playbooks

### site.yaml

Playbook to apply `docker`, `rke_node`, `rke_rancher_clusters` & `custom_rk8s_cluster`. Check [plays/prepare_k8s_nodes.yaml](./plays/prepare_k8s_nodes.yaml), [plays/deploy_rancher.yaml](./plays/deploy_rancher.yaml) & [plays/deploy_k8s_cluster.yaml](./plays/deploy_k8s_cluster.yaml) for details.

### cleanup_k8snode.yaml

With this playbook to can cleanup a node which was already added to a kubernetes cluster. Based on https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/cleaning-cluster-nodes/

## Roles

### Docker

Simple role to install Docker. Check [roles/docker/README.md](./roles/docker/README.md) for more details.

### rke_node

Role to prepare a vm which then can be used as a node in a Rancher Control Plane or a custom Kubernetes Cluster. The role currently only configures firewalld depending on the `k8s_role` the node has. Based on https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/options/firewall/

### rke_rancher_clusters

Role to deploy a Rancher Control Plane with `rke` and `helm`. Check [roles/rke_rancher_clusters/README.md](./roles/rke_rancher_clusters/README.md) for more details.

### custom_rk8s_cluster

Role to create a custom kubernetes cluster on a Rancher Control Plane and add nodes to the cluster. Check [roles/custom_k8s_cluster/README.md](./roles/custom_k8s_cluster/README.md) for more details.
